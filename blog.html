                        Discuss the scope of var, let, and const

                        <p>
                            In JavaScript, var, let, and const are used to declare variables, but they have different
                            scopes and behaviors. Understanding their scope is crucial for writing clean and bug-free
                            code. Let's discuss the scope of each of these variable declarations:
                        <ul>
                            <li class="mt-4">
                                var:

                                var has a function-level scope, which means it is limited to the function in which it is
                                declared or, if declared outside of any function, it becomes a global variable.
                                Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their containing function or
                                global
                                context during the compilation phase, which means they are initialized with undefined
                                before
                                the code is executed.
                                It is not block-scoped, so if declared inside a block (such as an if statement or a for
                                loop), the variable is still accessible outside of that block.
                            </li>
                            <li class="my-4">
                                let:

                                let was introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and has a block-level scope, which means it is
                                limited to the block (enclosed by curly braces) in which it is declared.
                                Variables declared with let are also hoisted, but they are not initialized with a value.
                                They remain in a "temporal dead zone" until they are actually declared in the code.
                                It allows you to create variables that are limited in scope to specific blocks, making
                                it safer and more predictable than var.
                            </li>
                            <li class="">
                                const:

                                const is also introduced in ES6 and has a block-level scope, similar to let.
                                Unlike let, variables declared with const cannot be reassigned after they are declared.
                                However, for objects and arrays declared with const, their properties or elements can be
                                modified.
                                Like let, const variables are also hoisted but are not initialized with a value.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                            In JavaScript, null and undefined are both special values that indicate the absence of a
                            meaningful value. However, they are used in slightly different contexts and have distinct
                            use cases:

                        <ul>
                            <li class="mt-4">
                                undefined:

                                undefined is a primitive value in JavaScript that represents the absence of a value or
                                the lack of initialization of a variable.
                                It is typically automatically assigned to a variable that has been declared but not
                                initialized with a value.
                                It is often used to check if a variable or property exists or has been defined.
                                Common use cases for undefined include:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Checking for the existence of function arguments:
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Checking if an object property exists:
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                            </li>
                            <li class="my-4">
                                null:

                                null is also a primitive value in JavaScript that represents the intentional absence of
                                any object value or a placeholder for an object that doesn't exist or hasn't been
                                initialized.
                                It is typically used when you want to explicitly indicate that a variable or property
                                should have no value or when you want to clear an object reference.
                                Common use cases for null include:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Clearing object references:
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Indicating the absence of a value:
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            In summary, undefined is often used to represent the absence of a value due to variable
                            initialization, while null is used to indicate the intentional absence of an object value or
                            to clear object references. Both are important in JavaScript for handling various scenarios
                            and making your code more robust and predictable.

                            A REST API, which stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming
                            Interface, is a foundational architecture for designing web services and networked
                            applications. It follows a set of principles that promote simplicity, scalability, and
                            interoperability. In the world of REST, resources are central, and each resource is
                            identified by a unique URI, such as a web URL, representing data entities or concepts.
                            Clients communicate with these resources using standard HTTP methods like GET (to retrieve
                            data), POST (to create new resources), PUT (to update resources), and DELETE (to remove
                            them). REST APIs are stateless, meaning each request from a client to a server must contain
                            all necessary information, and the server doesn't retain information about the client's
                            state. These APIs use different data representations, such as JSON or XML, and they
                            encourage a uniform and consistent interface, making them a popular choice for building web
                            services that enable seamless communication between diverse software applications on the
                            internet.
